For this project work, I have used FLAME Dataset (Link to the files given below). At first I have loaded the image files into jupyter notebook and checked ofr the distribution of each class. Then have prepared a baseline CNN model which gives an test accuracy of 65%.

Steps to execute the jupyter notebook.
1. download the dataset,Unzip the folders and keep it in same directory as the notebook
2. execute the notebook
